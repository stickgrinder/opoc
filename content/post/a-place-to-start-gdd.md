When me and Paolo started to think about this project together, the programming was not our main interest. The fact is, we both work in the field of ICT consultancy but we mutually consider ourselves as creative persons, and we found that we were more interested in the design of the game, the art direction of it.

Even thou we have different backgrounds, we both share the love for gaming (digital and analogical). The idea of creating our own stuff for games has always been in our DNA, because some of our passions are built on the assumption that the players become part of the creative process, building peices of the game they play. To make myself clear, for most of the Dungeon Masters RPGs, the act of giving birth to new mechanics, NPCs, adventures becomes instinctual, until you find yourself forging entire new worlds.
That's what we wanted to experience with a GA.

I studied desing at university, and I usually read articles about game design, so we decided that the first artifact of our GA should have been a **Game Design Document** (GDD).

## Why a GDD?

As a designer I know that the creative process is built on great ideas but also on methodology and discipline, and even thou I'm not a trained game designer I read about the use of GDD and found some interesting points that fit perfectly our goals.

First: the output is not a finished game, but instead a description of it. In my mind a GDD should be a resource that, when given to a developer, contains all the informations necessary to create the game, without describing the details of the implementation. It should have the foundations for all the parts of the game, leaving to the experts the freedom to develop them using their particular skills. So if you imagine a game design team made of some artists, developers, sound designers, animators, writers, each one of them should knwo where to find the parts they should work on and what's the expected outcome for all of them. The game designer, is the director of all the process, the person that takes decisions affecting the game as a whole, and the keeper of the consistency of the game. The GDD is the master book, where the game is described as a project.
That's what we wanted: a description of the game, made of some sketches, graphs, lines of dialogue.

Second: we thought that working with a GDD in mind as outcome could help us doing this side project one step at a time, as a sort of guideline.
You probably know this: work, family, and life in general, leaves you with little time for your stuff, so we found it was imporant for us to focus on a process that could give us small steps and rewards.

Third: The idea of a GDD helps us a lot to focus on the value of what we are doing, because beside the work for yourself, it forces you to answer a perpetual question: is the structure of what I'm writing here clear enough for a reader? Am I giving something for granted?
We gave ourselves a rough list of steps to start with, some points that we thought would be essential to understand the big picure of the game, using this question as a guideline. So far is working quite well.

Forth: a GDD it is a good starting point for the future. Let's say you decide to take your project to the next step, and find a company to develop it, the GDD - even thou it is clearly not the tool to _sell_ your idea - in my opinion is a great tool to describe your game and it highlights the fact you have actually designed it, and took it seriously as a project.


## What we are writing in our GDD

When we started writing the document we also tried to create a list of what we thought should be inside of it. A list helps us to undestand how much work is left and, while working on a step, to note down anything relevant that could be useful in the next ones.

This is the table of contents we made.
Right now some of these points are far from  done, or even started, but that's part of the plan: we write down what we think it will be useful and, as soon as we get there, we decide if it still is. We'll try to update you about this in some future posts.

* an abstract of the game plot
* a brief description of the plot itself divided in four acts
* a small section of aestethic influences
 * what styles of graphics we like for a GA
 * what styles we think are suitable for our GA
* a representation of the puzzles of the first act
* a detailed description of the elment of the first act
 * locations
 * characters
 * objects and items
 * relevand lines of dialogue
* a map of the connections between the locations

## Some final thoughts about the GDD

So fare this approach to our project seems to be a good one.
I personally have some doubts about the nature of the GDD, that I will try to analyze with time. I always think that a methodology should be followed and trusted, but also adapted to the teams and situations, so I'm summarizing the biggest concerns about the GDD here, for future personal references and to share them with anyone interested.

*Agility*
Coming from the ICT we know that writing a big upfront document it is against come philosofies that would like the design and the development to be paired in a more agile strategy. I wonder if this applies in this context too.

*Readability*
We also know that a document is a linear artifact - it is something you read from the top to the bottom - and it's inadequate to represent something so complex as a game like a GA. For example, there are many objects and cross references between them.


That's it :)
