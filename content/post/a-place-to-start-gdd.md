When me and Paolo started to think about this project together, the programming was not our main interest. The fact is, we both work in the field of ICT consultancy but we mutually consider ourselves as creative persons, and we found that we were more interested in the design of the game, the art direction of it.

Even though we have different backgrounds, we both share the love for gaming (either digital or analogic). The idea of creating our own gaming stuff has always been in our DNA, because some of our passions are built on the assumption that the players become part of the creative process, building pieces of the game they play. To make myself clear, for most of the Dungeon Masters RPGs, the act of giving birth to new mechanics, NPCs, adventures becomes instinctual, until you find yourself forging entire new worlds.
That's what we wanted to experience with a GA.

I studied design at university, and I usually read articles about game design, so I proposed that the first artifact of our GA should have been a **Game Design Document** (GDD).

## Why a GDD?

As a designer I know that the creative process is built on great ideas but also on methodology and discipline, and even though I'm not a trained game designer I read about the use of GDD and found some interesting points that perfectly fit our goals.

First: the output is not a finished game, but instead a description of it. In my mind a GDD should be a resource that provides a developer with all the informations necessary to create the game, without describing the details of the implementation. It should have the foundations for all the parts of the game, leaving to the experts the freedom to develop them using their particular skills and tastes. So if you envision a game design team, made of some artists, developers, sound designers, animators, writers, each one of them should know where to find the parts they should work on and what the expected outcome for all of them is. The game designer is the director of all the process, the person that takes decisions affecting the game as a whole, and the keeper of the overall consistency. The GDD is the master book, where the game is described as a project.

**That's what we wanted: a description of the game, made of some sketches, graphs, lines of dialogue.**

Second: we thought that working with a GDD as our expected outcome could help us doing this side project one step at a time. The GDD would act as a sort of guideline, forcing a sustainable pace.
You probably know this: work, family, and life in general, leaves you with little time for your stuff, so we found it was important to focus on a process that could give us small steps and frequent rewards.

**If you are an 10pm warrior like us, don't underestimate the need to get rewarded and take fun off your project, or you will risk to eventually lose interest in it.**

Third: The idea of a GDD helps us a lot to focus on the value of what we are doing, because beside the work for yourself, it forces you to answer a perpetual question: is the structure of what I'm writing here clear enough for a reader? Am I giving something for granted?
We gave ourselves a rough list of steps to start with, some points that we thought would be essential to understand the big picure of the game, using this question as a guideline. So far is working quite well.

**Walking in your target's shoes helps providing valuable information and valuable information is what you need to craft a great product.**

Fourth: a GDD it is a good starting point for the future. Let's say you decide to take your project to the next step, and find a company to develop it; the GDD - even though it is clearly not the tool to _sell_ your idea - is, in my opinion, a great tool to describe your game and it highlights the fact you have actually designed it, and took it seriously as a project.

**A good design talks about your love for your project. A GDD can shout it out loud.**


## What we are writing in our GDD

When we started writing the document we also tried to create a list of what we thought it should have contained. A list helps us to undestand how much work still has to be done and, while working on a step, to note down anything relevant that could be useful in the next ones.

This is the table of contents we made.
Right now some of these points are far from done (not even started, actually) but that's part of the plan: we write down what we think it will be useful and, as soon as we get there, we decide if it still is. We'll try to update you about this in some future posts.

* a seed, the abstract of the game plot
* a brief description of the plot itself divided in four acts
* a small section of aestethic influences
 * what styles of graphics we like for a GA
 * what styles we think are suitable for our GA
* a schematic representation of the puzzles of the first act
* a detailed description of the elements in the first act
 * locations
 * characters
 * objects and items
 * relevant lines of dialogue
* a map of the connections between the locations

## Some final thoughts about the GDD

So far, this approach to our project seems to be a good one.
I personally have some doubts about the nature of the GDD, that I will try to analyze with time. I always think that a methodology should be followed and trusted, but also adapted to the teams and situations, so I'm summarizing the biggest concerns about the GDD here, for future personal references and to share them with anyone interested.

**Agility**
Coming from the ICT we know that writing a big upfront document goes against those philosophies that would like the design and the development to be paired in a more agile strategy. I wonder if this applies to this context too.

**Readability**
We also know that a document is a linear artifact - it is something you read from the top to the bottom - and it's inadequate to represent something so complex as a game like a GA. For example, there are many objects and cross references between them.

That's it :)
