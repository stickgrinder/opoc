When me and Paolo started to think about this project together, the idea of developing a game - I mean by actually so some programming stuff - was not our main interest. The fact is, we both work in the field of ICT consultancy but we mutually consider ourselves as creative persons, and we found that we were more interested in the design of the game, the art direction of it.

Even thou we have different backgorunds, we both share the love for gaming (digital and analogical). The concept of creating our own stuff for games has always been in our DNA, because some of our passions are built on the idea that the players become the actor of creating peices of the game they play. For most of the Dungeon Masters RPGs, giving birth to new mechanics, NPCs, adventures becomes instinctual, until you find yourself forging entire new worlds.

That's what we wanted to experience with a GA.
I studied desing at university, and I usually read articles about game design, so we decided that the first artifact of our GA should have been a **Game Design Document** (GDD).

## Why a GDD?

As a designer I know that the creative process is built on great ideas but also on methodology and discipline, and even thou I'm not a trained game designer I read about the use of GDD and found some interesting points that fit perfectly our goals.

First: the output is not a finished game, but instead a description of it. In my mind a GDD should be a resource that, when given to a developer, gives all the informations necessary to create the game, without going too deep in the details of the implementation. It should have the foundations for all the parts of the game, leaving to the experts the freedom to develop them using their particular skills. So if you imagine a game design team made of some artists, developers, sound designers, animators, writers, each one of them should knwo where to find the parts they should work on and what's the expected outcome for all of them. The game designer, is the director of all the process, the person that takes decisions affecting the game as a whole and the keeper of the consistency of the game. The GDD is the master book, where the game is described as a project.
That's what we wanted: a description of the game, made of some sketches, graphs, lines of dialogue.

Second: we thought that working with a GDD in mind as outcome could help us doing this side project one step a time, with order.
You probably know this: work, family, and life in general, leaves you with little time for your stuff, so we it is imporanto for us to focus on a process that could give us small steps and rewards. The idea of a GDD helps us a lot in this, because it forces yourself with a question: is the structure of what I'm writing here clear enough to a reader? We gave ourselves a rough list of steps to start with, some points that we think can help a reader to understand the big picure of the game.

* a concept
* a schema of the acts
* a graph representing each act
* the definition of the single parts of each act
 * locations
 * characters
 * objects and items
 * dialogues


Third, a GDD it is a good starting point for the future. Let's say you decide to take your project to the next step, and find a company to develop it, the GDD - even thou it clearly not the tool to _sell_ your idea - seems to me a great tool to describe your game and it highlights the fact you have designed it, and took it seriously.


## What we are writing inside our GDD

* i contenuti che abbiamo per adesso inserito nel documento sono i seguenti
    * un soggetto
    * una descrizione per sommi capi della trama nei quattro atti
    * una piccola sezione sulle influenze in termini estetici
        * cosa ci piace
        * quale estetica pensiamo sia adatta al genere di AG che stiamo pensando
* i contenuti che abbiamo programmato di inserire per adesso sono:
    * uno schema degli enigmi del primo atto che descriva
        * l’obiettivo del primo atto
        * cosa serve per raggiungerlo
    * una descrizione dettagliata degli elementi del primo atto
    * una mappa concettuale che descriva il collegamento tra le location
    * uno schema che rappresenti la complessità degli enigmi (su questo abbiamo fatto qualche prova cercando di rendere in forma di uno schema altre avventure come il primo atto di The Last Door)

## Some final thoughts about the GDD

* al momento questo ci sembra un approccio degno di nota
* arrivando dal mondo dell’ICT sappiamo che è in contrasto, apparente con le filosofie più legato allo Scrumm e al Lean in generale
* un documento sappiamo che è un artefatto lineare, e forse è parzialmente inadeguato per quello che dobbiamo fare (le cross reference sono importanti quando si descrive qualcosa di così complesso)
