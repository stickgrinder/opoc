Even for inexperienced noobs as we are, it was clear that we needed some raw idea to elaborate on, to keep us on rails.  
When you are eager to craft your AGs you can into a common pitfall, a tendency known as [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding), which is a form of distraction.  
Having a good adventure seed will help you focusing your efforts on a real goal and will provide the meat of you work.

## So what's a seed?

The idea of "seed" is very simple and pretty all creative discipline implements it. Think about a movie's brief:

> A ridicolously rich guy with scars in his past decide to employ his seemingly infinite resources to fight the bad guys, dressed in a bat suite. He will leave the gloomy city for a long journey, endure an ordeal, learn from a ninja master who will eventually be touched by evil and fight him in a final showdown.

This is (my version of) the seed for _Batman Begins_.

What's notable here?

1. The seed don't get too much into detail
2. It reads quickly and set a starting point, an ending point and foreshadow what's in between.
3. The goal is clearly not the same as a script or a plot: instead the seed conveys an idea in broad lines.

Let's dig deeper into its function.

## Why would I bother?

We listed some properties of the example seed.  
Those are not all the properties a **good** seed should have, but we'd like to focus on that one first.  
If we had to describe the seed with a single word, it would be _concise_.

Summarizing the function of a seed will probably helo us understanding why is should be so:

### Convey a broad idea of the plot

In the seed above you can see the main elements of a classic Propp structure: falling from grace, 
* Convey the general mood of the final product
* Give ideas to build upon as a team (if you do all by yourself you'll probably discover a different self as you change you hat)
* Be easy to throw away
* Mention the main elements of the story
