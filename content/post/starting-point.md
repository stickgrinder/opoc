The first time I played a point 'n click adventure I was around eleven.  
At that time, if a computing machine was somewhere to be found in your house, you was supposed to fall in one of two categories: either you were the lucky owner of an Amiga/SEGA/Nintendo - able to access tons of the greatest games in the world; or you owned a dull IBM PC/Compatible.  
Trust me, playing on a PC back then was not the blast it is today!

So when I managed to put my hands on a copy of **Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade** by LucasFilm Games Ltd. I was totally aroused! Looking forward for a great platform, with Indy whiping bad guys on a train roof, I had a bit of satback when the game started... what was I looking at? Why so much talkin'? Where the action was?

One hour later I was totally hooked by the game. It was 1989. **The Secret of Monkey Island** was months away.

I won't dig deeper into memories (and save you yet another nostalgic blurb), but it suffices to say that I eventually became a developer with the dream of creating my own AG.  
Too bad development ain't all you need to create a great game. Fast forward 7... no, 17... er... 27 **\°o°/** years and here I am driving a web-development firm. Which of course has nothing to do with game development.

But.

Enters Marcello (c'mon Marcello, say hello!).  
A creative mind, colleague and dear friend, we share almost the same passions, included the one for AGs. So here we are, trying to make one.

## What's this blog about then? Your AG?

Not exactly.

If we exclude some indie product for the tabletop RPG game industry and a bunch of never-to-be-finished stubs, we had little to no experience crafting games. So we found ourselves in the need to hack our way from zero to hero.  
Online resources about "the art of crafting good AGs" are few and spare: there is a number of great tools devoted to AG development, a small bunch of good resources about how to create good puzzles, but nothing about the process, from initial seed to final product.

We were overwhelmed by questions: what comes first? Which deliverables we'll have to produce? How important puzzles are? Should they come before of after the game story? Are there any method to tell what's achievable in the "8pm project" time-budget? How much pixel-art animation costs? Which steps will make us saving time?

After reading some resources we found here and there (a process which sadly took no more that a couple of evenings) we decided to grind our brains over the problem, come up with a process stub and go one step at a time, trying to keep an eye on ourselves and understand the process.

We soon got that without keeping a project journal, a lot of gotchas and understanding would have been lost, so here we are.

## Is this a project journal, then?

Yes, but not about the game itself.

Thinks of this more as a **process journal**. We'll try to post here all the knowledge we'll be able to produce about _making an AG_. We'll collect epiphanies, steps, tools, successes and failures, example of deliverables, and a lot of useless words (and brackets, as you can see).

The goal is to create a solid knowledge base for everybody who wants to make an AG and has no idea where to start. We are not pros, nor experts so it's easy this journal will end up being a pile of crap, from a professional game-designer point of view.

Still that's what we have to offer: our experience. We are taking a lot of fun in the process and we hope you'll be encouraged to take the same fun too! We look forward for a new AGs golden age (which is sort of coming, somehow), so take this as our contribution to our very hopes.  
Should our brainchild never see the light of day, we'd be delighted if someone else will produce a great game, mused by the content of this blog.

Stay tuned! :)
