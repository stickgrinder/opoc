Even for inexperienced noobs as we are, it was clear that we needed some raw idea to elaborate on, to keep us on rails.  
When you are eager to craft your AGs you can run into a common pitfall, a tendency known as [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding), which is a form of distraction.  
Having a good adventure seed will help you focusing your efforts on a real goal and will provide the meat of you work.

## So what's a seed?

The idea of "seed" is very simple and pretty all creative discipline implements it. Think about a movie's brief:

> A ridicolously rich guy with scars in his past decides to employ his seemingly infinite resources to fight the bad guys, dressed in a bat suite. He will leave the gloomy city for a long journey, endure an ordeal, learn from a ninja master who will eventually be touched by evil and fight him in a final showdown.

This is (my version of) the seed for _Batman Begins_.

What's notable here?

1. The seed don't get too much into detail
2. It reads quickly and set a starting point, an ending point and foreshadow what's in between.
3. The goal is clearly not the same as a script or a plot: instead the seed conveys an idea in broad lines.

Let's dig deeper into its function.

## Why would I bother?

We listed some properties of the example seed.  
Those are not all the properties a **good** seed should have, but we'd like to focus on those ones first.  
If we had to describe the seed with a single word, it would be _concise_.

Summarizing the function of a seed will probably help us understanding why is should be so:

### Convey a broad idea of the plot

In the seed above you can see the main elements of a classic "simplified" Propp structure: falling from grace, enduring an  ordeal, finding a magical aid, confronting the nemesis and restoring the initial condition in a new situation. 
This is the way 99% of fiction works and ideally no fable can be called that way if it doesn't adhere to this schema. Even _Monkey Island_ does at some extent.

Whichever schema your plot is based upon, it must emerge from the seed. In particular, make explicit where it all starts from and where it is supposed to end.

**Example of a seed that fails to conveying a plot:**

> On a pirates island all mutters about a long lost treasure hidden on a monkeyhead-shaped atoll. Will the wannabe pirate with the funny name be able to get his hands on it? Charming mayors, ghost pirates and other funny guys will be in the middle to make things worse. 

### Introduce characters

A good seed makes at least clear who the main character is going to be. Better yet it introduce the confrontation (be it a villain or a incumbent menace of sort). 
No need to go into much details about them, but giving a general idea of the archetype and character mood is a good idea. This will guide the whole concept of the characters from a steady starting point.

In particular I want to point my attention in _describing by aspects_. I will steal the definition of _aspect_ from the [FATE Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/):

> An aspect is a phrase that describes something unique or noteworthy about whatever it’s attached to. 
> They [...] influence the story by providing an opportunity for a character to get a bonus, complicating a character’s life, or adding to another character [...] or passive opposition.

Most notably, an **interesting** aspect is not inherently good or bad: it is something that can either push or compell a character when she confronts a situation. This is not a must, most gonzo adventures have black-and-white characters who keeps a consistent attitude throughout the whole story arc. Yet, knowing you can twist your scenes and turn a weakness in a boon (or the other way round) is a solid value.

### List all pivots

By pivot here I am talking about turning points, not all possible twists. 
Ideally the seed will give us the structure of the "chapters" our adventure will be broken up into. Not to say that all AGs should be structured in parts: talking about a theoretical separation here.

This point is particularly important as we'll see in the next articles about how to structure puzzles. So far it suffice to say that having an idea of the adventure chunks will help us define which _gates_ will lead from a chunk to the next. Making this clear will be key to define the conditions and ultimately, the puzzles.

## Non functional features

Aside from the seed's content, a good seed should also:

* Convey the general mood of the final product
* Give ideas to build upon as a team (if you do all by yourself you'll probably discover a different self as you change your hat)
* Be easy to throw away

The last point can seem counterintuitive but reality is, when you are in the very stages of your design and unless you already have nurtured your AG concept for years, you'll want to brainstorm a lot of possible seeds to chose among them which one will become your next masterpiece.

So don't spend too much time refining your seed in the brainstorming phase: jot them down, do your best and remember all ideas, even the stranger ones, can become viable if properly developed (looking at you, _Sharknado_!)

## The seed goals

We ended up with a depiction of the good seed's anatomy. 
Now _qui prodest_?

The target of the seed, as of the whole [GDD](/post/a-place-to-start-gdd/) is yourself and your team. The seed can guide creatives, artists, the marketing guys and ultimately yourself to flesh out the broader view.

The seed is not immutable, but should be a _first-line filter_ to tell if an idea about the game is good or not. It will help you being consistent, so once you have chosen your seed, settle on it unless evidence tells you it has to be changed. And if you do, consider having all your staff on board before making any change: they will have to understand them and incorporate them both in the work they will do **and** in the one they have already done!

## Conclusion

You should be good to go now.

If you want some other great advice on how to write good seeds, take a look at those other articles. They don't refer to AGs (they are written for tabletob RPGs instead), but they'll surely add value and a slightly different POV on this important topic.
